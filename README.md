# Basic Overview

Screenr is a web application that allows you to browse movies and tv shows. In addition, you can view a basic set of information for each one including a short description, the cast, the year released and more!

Building this application was an opportunity for me to try out Svelte. Verdict? Svelte is amazing to work with. It's intuitive, fast and powerful, easy to learn and fun to work with.
